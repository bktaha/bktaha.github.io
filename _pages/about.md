I'm a second-year pre-doctoral research associate for [Professor Eric Verhoogen](http://www.columbia.edu/~ev2124/) at the School of International and Public Affairs, `Columbia University`.🏛 I studied Physics and Mathematics at the `Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati`.🇮🇳

I've studied the adoption and effects of predictive technologies in state and private institutions in a developing country with my stints at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia) and one of India's largest private sector retail banks.📈 I think about the drivers of `learning` in the absence of reliable feedback and in an ever-changing policy and technology environment - through the lens of `development economics` and `public finance`.📝

I've been up to some [stuff](https://bktaha.github.io/assets/pdf/ResumeWorded-EH4.pdf). I also have a newfound interest in baseball and [D&D](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OP03XyK-pTc) and a longtime fascination with [movies](https://letterboxd.com/tahakb/) and cycling. Thank God for New York City.🗽
